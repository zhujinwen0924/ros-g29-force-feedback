# Overview
Ros package to control force feedback of logitech g29 steering wheel from ros message, written in c++, for human beings all over the world.
This is useful for the user interface of autonomous driving, driving simulator like [CARLA](https://carla.org/), [LGSVL](https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/) etc.

# Features
* Standalone ros package to control steering wheel. (doesn't depend on the other ros packages like ros-melodic-joy etc.)

* We can control angle of logitech g29 steering wheel with throwing ros message.

* Two control modes - They are changed dynamically through topic.
    1. PID control mode  
        Rotate wheel to the specified angle with PID control.(I controller is now deprecated). This mode can rotate wheel to the specified angle with your hands off, so this mode is useful for the user interface of autonomous driving system. Control force can not be specified (max force can be specified with rosparam).

    1. Constant force mode  
        Rotate wheel to the specified angle with specified constant force (up to max force specified with rosparam). This mode make it easier to control vehicle manually in the driving simulator. If you use with your hands off and rotate force over 0.3, the wheel travels right and left. So it's better to use PID mode if you wanna use this with your hands off. 

# Demo
![demo_gif](https://github.com/kuriatsu/ros-g29-force-feedback/blob/image/images/force_feedback_test.gif)

# Requirement
* ubuntu
* ros melodic
* Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel

To check whether your kernel supports force feedback, do as follows
```bash
$ cat /boot/config-5.3.0-46-generic | grep CONFIG_LOGIWHEELS_FF
CONFIG_LOGIWHEELS_FF=y
```  
If you cannot get `CONFIG_LOGIWHEELS_FF=y`, try to find patch...

# Install
1. create catkin_ws
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/any/dir
    mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
    cd /catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/zhujinwen0924/ros-g29-force-feedback.git
    cd ../
    catkin_make
    ```
    
# Usage
1. confirm your device name
    ```bash
    $ cat /proc/bus/input/devices
    ```
    find **Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel** and check Handlers (ex. event19)

1. change parameters in **g29_force_feedback.yaml**
    |parameter|default|description|
    |:--|:--|:--|
    |device_name|/dev/input/event19|device name, change the number|
    |Kp|1|P value of PID contol|
    |Ki|0.0|I value of PID contol (Deprecated)|
    |Kd|0.1|D value of PID contol|
    |offset|0.01|affordable radian(offset * 2.5&pi;) of control|
    |max_force|1.0|max force|
    |min_force|0.2|0.25 is best! less than 0.2 cannot turn the wheel (in my case)|
    |pub_rate|0.1|event update rate (0.1=10Hz)|

1. run ros node
    ```bash
    $ source /path/to/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    $ roslaunch g29_force_feedback g29_force_feedback.launch
    ```

1. Throw message (It's better to use tab completion)  
    ```bash
    $ rostopic pub /ff_target g29-force-feedback/ForceFeedback "header:
      seq: 0
      stamp:
        secs: 0
        nsecs: 0
      frame_id: ''
    angle: 0.3
    force: 0.0
    pid_mode: true"
    ```

    or you can run ./test.sh(in src/ros-g29-force-feedback) to publish a topic.
    Once the message is thrown, the wheel rotates to 0.3*2.5&pi; with PID control (the bigger the gap between current angle and specified angle is, the bigger the rotation force is.).
    Publish rate is not restricted. The value is ignored if you set pid_mode.

# Change Log

## 2020-10-10
### changed
PID-Constant mode can be changed dynamically!!
Removed mode selection from rosparam.
Rotation force is ignored when PID mode. (max force can be specified with rosparam (not dynamic))

## 2021-06-06
### changed
Wrapped a launch file and test.sh.
